			  <h4><b>Sal's Journey </b></h4>																												
			  <div class="ff">
			    <p>Sal's journey started as a seed planted when he was 10 years old. With his found vhs camcorder and assisted by his sister
				  he started with action-comedies. He created his own stories and acted them out. Then editing them to a finished short film.</p>
				<p>Sal's theatre acting started in his sophmore year at Loara High School. In a remake of the classic film "12 Angry Men" the school did
					a production called "12 Angry Jurors" in which Sal played juror #3. Equivalent to the part played by George C. Scott in the movie.
					He then was cast cast in a 1700 restoation comedy called "The Beaux Strategy"at Cypress Junior College. He played the character of Aimwell.
					The play was the equivalent of "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", that's where he co-starred with Danny from "Local Super Heroes".</p>
				<p>Danny then introduced Sal to a group called "Local Super Heroes", made up of RJ, Danny and Adam. They were producing parodies of films and Sal joined
					them. First in rehearsal, then doing back of production duties. His first role was in a parody of a music video of "Stacey's Mom".</p>
				<p>Going between Theatre and film is a natural for Sal. Forming up a production company called "Laughing Owl Productions" and Producing 
					short films like "Sal buys a Megaphone" to perorming in an on-line Shakespear production "As You Like It" shows his versatility.
					"as You Like It" was Sal's first venture into Shakespear, playing the part of Orlando. The challenge of producing a play during Covid-19 
					and overcoming the obstacles shows that you can unite and create.</p>
				<p>Sal's last serious film making took place Last Movember, where he wrote a series of poems and then visualized and interpeted them by filming then producing 
					short films. Sal recently was cast in a short film playing a homeless man. So even in quartantine he still is remaining viable with his involvement 
					in the film making process.</p>

			   <h5><b>Sal's Film Mentors</b></h5>
			   <div class="a">	
				<img src="akira.jpg" alt="akira" width="150" height="180" align="right" />
				<p><b>Akira Kirosawa</b> <br />
			    I asked Sal about who his film influences are and as expected Akira Kurosawa came up.
				Sal took apragmatic approach and explained that Kurosawa transcended the genre. Akira 
				took a perspective that Sal feels he can't achieve but will strive for. Kurosawa's 
				films are cultural and temporal at their best and you know your looking at the best that
				was produced at that time. "The Seventh Samurai"is problaby the best example of that.</p> 
				</div><!--a-->
				<div class="b">

				<img src="Quentin.jpg" alt="Quentin" width="150" height="160" align="left"/>
				<p></p><b>Quentin Tarantino</b><br />
			     Tarantino is just fun film making and you can feel it. With his use of language or colorful 
				metaphors and ultra violence Tarantino builds the anticipation of a scene smoothly and flows 
				naturally. I asked if "Pulp Fiction" was his favorite and Sal responded with "once Upon a 
				Time in Hollywood"as his favorite film. Sal cited the personal references with the music
				allowing a modern LA flavor that put you there.</p>
				</div><!--b-->
				<div class="c">
			   <img src="kubrik.jpg" alt="Kubrik" width="150" height="180" align="right"/>
			    <p><b>Stanley Kubrik</b><br />
		        Sal seemed paricularly inclined to Stanley Kubrik. He felt that Kubrik transcends the genre.
				Each movie is different and reflected the stories that Kubrik liked. Kubrik has a way of skirting 
				around a scene using a visual style and dialogue to reflect his personal journey through the mdeium.
				Sal cited the fact that Kubrik used tech and period accuracy to an advantage that allows the
				viewer to look through Kubrik's eyes. The best example in Sal's eyes is "Barry Lyndon". </p>
